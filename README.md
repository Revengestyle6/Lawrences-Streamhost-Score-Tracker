This project only works for Mario Kart Wii's 5v5 war format, and is meant for streamhosts of matches casted with graphics.

In OBS, connect Score(H).txt and Score(A).txt to a text object and place them on the left and right side of the bar respectively.
Connect racecount.txt to a text object and place it in a readable location.

After each race, type in the positions the home team (which is the team displayed on the left) scored that race, and all points will be calculated properly.
  - DO NOT INCLUDE 10TH, ONLY ADD 9TH IF THE HOME TEAM SCORED BAGGER POINT
Type in all penalties once confirmed by a referee.
